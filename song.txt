There's no time for us
There's no place for us
What is this thing that builds our dreams
Yet tips 'em 'way from us
Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?
There's no chance for us
It's all decided for us
This world has only one sweet moment
Set aside for us
Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?
Who?
